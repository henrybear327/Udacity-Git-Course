What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When I initialize a git repository, git will create a metadata folder called
  .git in the directory that I run the command git init.
  I will need this because it's git's lifeblood. Everything that git needs is
  in there.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is a good place to group every piece of logically connected
  changes together for a commit. It gives programmers a chance to make good
  log on code changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  Use git status often to check for modification. Use git add file to group
  changes accordingly.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  Take my own experience for example, while I was working on my email parsing
  project, it's very handy to create a new branch and work on it, being
  brave to try everything that's new to me. I can be totally confident that
  if I messed up anything, I will always have a fallback version that easy to
  access. On the other hand, if things go well, I can merge those changes into
  the master branch, thus, making my code much better.
  Also, while perform bug fixes, the branch feature will come in handy, too.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  Long story short, now I am finally able to interpret the meaning of the
  detached head state and branching concepts.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

  The result will be the code bases are joint and commit messages are sorted
  by time.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
